## What is Pytorch?  
PyTorch is an open source machine learning (ML) framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. It is one of the preferred platforms for deep learning research.  
  
## What is Key Features and Capabilities?  
**Production Ready**  
Transition seamlessly between eager and graph modes with TorchScript, and accelerate the path to production with TorchServe.  
  
**Distributed Training**  
Scalable distributed training and performance optimization in research and production is enabled by the torch.distributed backend.  
  
**Robust Ecosystem**  
A rich ecosystem of tools and libraries extends PyTorch and supports development in computer vision, NLP and more.  
  
**Cloud Support**  
PyTorch is well supported on major cloud platforms, providing frictionless development and easy scaling.
